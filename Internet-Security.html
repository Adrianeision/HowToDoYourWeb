          <h2>Passive Attacks vs. Active Attacks</h2>
            <ol>
            <li>The active attack includes <strong>modification</strong> of the message. On the other hand, in passive attacks, the attacker doesn’t commit any changes to the intercepted information.</li>
            <li>The active attack causes a huge amount of harm to the system while the passive attack doesn’t cause any harm to the system resources.</li>
            <li>A passive attack is considered as a threat to data confidentiality. In contrast, an active attack is a threat to the integrity and availability of the data.</li>
            <li>The attacked entity is aware of the attack in case of active attack. As against, the victim is unaware of the attack in the passive attack.</li>
            <li>The active attack is accomplished by gaining the physical control over the communication link to capture and insert transmission. On the contrary, in a passive attack, the attacker just needs to observe the transmission.</li>
            </ol>    
          <h2>What is Malware</h2>
            <p>Malware or "malicious software" is a broad term that describes any malicious program or code that is harmful to systems.<br>
            Hostile, intrusive, and intentionally nasty malware attempts to invade, damage, or disable computers, computer systems, networks, tablets, and mobile devices, often taking partial control of a device's operations. Like the flu, it interferes with normal function.<br>
            The intention of the malware is to illegally extract money from the user. Although malware cannot damage system hardware or network equipment - with one known exception (see Google's Android section) - it can steal, encrypt or erase your data, alter or hijack basic computer functions and spy on your computer activity without your knowledge or permission.<br>
            These are the most common criminals in the malware dishonesty gallery:</p>
