        <h1>Internet Security</h1>
          <h2>Passive Attacks vs. Active Attacks</h2>
            <ol>
            <li>The active attack includes <strong>modification</strong> of the message. On the other hand, in passive attacks, the attacker doesn’t commit any changes to the intercepted information.</li>
            <li>The active attack causes a huge amount of harm to the system while the passive attack doesn’t cause any harm to the system resources.</li>
            <li>A passive attack is considered as a threat to data confidentiality. In contrast, an active attack is a threat to the integrity and availability of the data.</li>
            <li>The attacked entity is aware of the attack in case of active attack. As against, the victim is unaware of the attack in the passive attack.</li>
            <li>The active attack is accomplished by gaining the physical control over the communication link to capture and insert transmission. On the contrary, in a passive attack, the attacker just needs to observe the transmission.</li>
            </ol>    
          <h2>What is Malware</h2>
            <p>Malware or "malicious software" is a broad term that describes any malicious program or code that is harmful to systems.<br>
            Hostile, intrusive, and intentionally nasty malware attempts to invade, damage, or disable computers, computer systems, networks, tablets, and mobile devices, often taking partial control of a device's operations. Like the flu, it interferes with normal function.<br>
            The intention of the malware is to illegally extract money from the user. Although malware cannot damage system hardware or network equipment - with one known exception (see Google's Android section) - it can steal, encrypt or erase your data, alter or hijack basic computer functions and spy on your computer activity without your knowledge or permission.<br>
            These are the most common criminals in the malware dishonesty gallery:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Adware is unwanted software designed to display advertisements on your screen, usually in a browser. It tends to resort to a surreptitious method: either pretending to be legitimate, or attaching itself to another program to deceive the user and install itself on their PC, tablet or mobile device.</li>
            <li>Spyware is malware that observes the user's activities on the computer secretly and without permission, and reports them to the author of the software.</li>
            <li>A virus is malware that attaches itself to another program and, when it runs — usually without the user's warning — it replicates itself by modifying other programs on the computer and infecting them with its own bits of code.</li>
            <li>Worms are a type of malware similar to viruses, which replicate itself in order to spread to other computers on a network, usually causing damage and destroying data and files.</li>
            <li>A Trojan, or Trojan horse, is one of the most dangerous types of malware. It is usually presented as something useful to mislead the user. Once it is on the system, the attackers behind the Trojan gain unauthorized access to the infected computer. From there, Trojans can be used to steal financial information or install threats such as viruses and ransomware.</li>
            <li>Ransomware is a type of malware that blocks user access to the device or encrypts their files and then forces them to pay a ransom to return them to them. Ransomware has been recognized as the cybercriminal's weapon of choice because it requires fast and profitable payment in hard-to-track cryptocurrency. The code behind the ransomware is easy to obtain through illegal online marketplaces and defending against it is very difficult.</li>
            <li>The rootkit is a type of malware that provides the attacker with administrator privileges on the infected system. Typically, it is also designed to remain hidden from the user, other system software, and the operating system itself.</li>
            <li>A keystroke logger is malware that records all of the user's keystrokes, stores the collected information, and sends it to the attacker, who searches for confidential information such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details.</li>
            <li>Malicious cryptocurrency mining, also known as fortuitous mining or cryptojacking, is an increasingly prevalent malware installed by a Trojan. Allow other people to use your computer to mine cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or monero. Cryptocurrency mining malicious programs use your computer's resources but send the coins obtained to their own accounts, not to those of the owner of the equipment. Simply put, a malicious cryptocurrency mining program steals your resources to make money.</li>
            <li>Exploits are a type of malware that exploits errors and vulnerabilities in a system so that the creator of the exploit can take control. The exploits are linked, among other threats, to malicious advertising, which attacks through a legitimate site that inadvertently downloads malicious content from a dangerous site. The harmful content then tries to install itself on the computer after an inadvertent download. You don't even need to click. All you have to do is visit a good place on the wrong day.</li>
