        <h1>Internet Security</h1>
          <h2>Passive Attacks vs. Active Attacks</h2>
            <ol>
            <li>The active attack includes <strong>modification</strong> of the message. On the other hand, in passive attacks, the attacker doesn’t commit any changes to the intercepted information.</li>
            <li>The active attack causes a huge amount of harm to the system while the passive attack doesn’t cause any harm to the system resources.</li>
            <li>A passive attack is considered as a threat to data confidentiality. In contrast, an active attack is a threat to the integrity and availability of the data.</li>
            <li>The attacked entity is aware of the attack in case of active attack. As against, the victim is unaware of the attack in the passive attack.</li>
            <li>The active attack is accomplished by gaining the physical control over the communication link to capture and insert transmission. On the contrary, in a passive attack, the attacker just needs to observe the transmission.</li>
            </ol>    
          <h2>What is Malware</h2>
            <p>Malware or <strong>"malicious software"</strong> is a broad term that describes any malicious program or code that is harmful to systems.<br>
            Hostile, intrusive, and intentionally nasty malware attempts to invade, damage, or disable computers, computer systems, networks, tablets, and mobile devices, often taking partial control of a device's operations. Like the flu, it interferes with normal function.<br>
            The intention of the malware is to illegally extract money from the user. Although malware cannot damage system hardware or network equipment - with one known exception (see Google's Android section) - it can steal, encrypt or erase your data, alter or hijack basic computer functions and spy on your computer activity without your knowledge or permission.<br>
            These are the most common criminals in the malware dishonesty gallery:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Adware</strong> is unwanted software designed to display advertisements on your screen, usually in a browser. It tends to resort to a surreptitious method: either pretending to be legitimate, or attaching itself to another program to deceive the user and install itself on their PC, tablet or mobile device.</li>
            <li><strong>Spyware</strong> is malware that observes the user's activities on the computer secretly and without permission, and reports them to the author of the software.</li>
            <li>A <strong>virus</strong> is malware that attaches itself to another program and, when it runs — usually without the user's warning — it replicates itself by modifying other programs on the computer and infecting them with its own bits of code.</li>
            <li><strong>Worms</strong> are a type of malware similar to viruses, which replicate itself in order to spread to other computers on a network, usually causing damage and destroying data and files.</li>
            <li>A <strong>Trojan</strong>, or Trojan horse, is one of the most dangerous types of malware. It is usually presented as something useful to mislead the user. Once it is on the system, the attackers behind the Trojan gain unauthorized access to the infected computer. From there, Trojans can be used to steal financial information or install threats such as viruses and ransomware.</li>
            <li><strong>Ransomware</strong> is a type of malware that blocks user access to the device or encrypts their files and then forces them to pay a ransom to return them to them. Ransomware has been recognized as the cybercriminal's weapon of choice because it requires fast and profitable payment in hard-to-track cryptocurrency. The code behind the ransomware is easy to obtain through illegal online marketplaces and defending against it is very difficult.</li>
            <li>The <strong>rootkit</strong> is a type of malware that provides the attacker with administrator privileges on the infected system. Typically, it is also designed to remain hidden from the user, other system software, and the operating system itself.</li>
            <li>A <strong>keystroke logger</strong> is malware that records all of the user's keystrokes, stores the collected information, and sends it to the attacker, who searches for confidential information such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details.</li>
            <li><strong>Malicious cryptocurrency mining</strong>, also known as fortuitous mining or cryptojacking, is an increasingly prevalent malware installed by a Trojan. Allow other people to use your computer to mine cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or monero. Cryptocurrency mining malicious programs use your computer's resources but send the coins obtained to their own accounts, not to those of the owner of the equipment. Simply put, a malicious cryptocurrency mining program steals your resources to make money.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploits</strong> are a type of malware that exploits errors and vulnerabilities in a system so that the creator of the exploit can take control. The exploits are linked, among other threats, to malicious advertising, which attacks through a legitimate site that inadvertently downloads malicious content from a dangerous site. The harmful content then tries to install itself on the computer after an inadvertent download. You don't even need to click. All you have to do is visit a good place on the wrong day.</li>
            </ul>
          <h2>Software and Hardware to Protect Network</h2>
              <p><strong>Firewalls</strong> are hardware appliances and software programs that act as a barrier between incoming traffic and the network. The firewall compares data packets that are sent over the network to predefined policies and rules that indicate whether or not the data should be permitted into the network.</p>
          <h2>Network Protocols</h2>
              <p>A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design. Network protocols are the reason you can easily communicate with people all over the world, and thus play a critical role in modern digital communications.<br>
                Similar to the way that speaking the same language simplifies communication between two people, network protocols make it possible for devices to interact with each other because of predetermined rules built into devices’ software and hardware. Neither local area networks (LAN) nor wide area networks (WAN) could function the way they do today without the use of network protocols.<br>
                Network protocols take large-scale processes and break them down into small, specific tasks or functions. This occurs at every level of the network, and each function must cooperate at each level to complete the larger task at hand. The term protocol suite refers to a set of smaller network protocols working in conjunction with each other.<br>
                Network protocols are typically created according to industry standard by various networking or information technology organizations.<br>
		      The following groups have defined and published different network protocols:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</strong> (IEEE)</li>
                  <li><strong>The Internet Engineering Task Force</strong> (IETF)</li>
                  <li><strong>The International Organization for Standardization</strong> (ISO)</li>
                  <li><strong>The International Telecommunications Union</strong> (ITU)</li>
                  <li><strong>The World Wide Web Consortium</strong> (W3C)</li>
              </ul>
                  <p>While network protocol models generally work in similar ways, each protocol is unique and operates in the specific way detailed by the organization that created it.</p>  
            <h2>Digital certificates and certificate authorities</h2>
                 <p>Digital certificates are issued by trusted parties, called certificate authorities, to verify the identity of an entity, such as a client or server.<br>
                     The digital certificate serves <strong>two purposes</strong>: it verifies the owner's identity and it makes the owner's public key available. It is issued with an expiration date, after which it is no longer guaranteed by the certificate authority (CA).<br>
                    To obtain a digital certificate, you send a request to the CA of your choice, such as Verisign, or RSA. The request includes your distinguished name, your public key, and your signature. A distinguished name (DN) is a unique identifier for each user or host for which you are applying for a certificate. The CA checks your signature using your public key and performs some level of verification of your identity (this varies with different CAs). After verification, the CA sends you a signed digital certificate that contains your distinguished name, your public key, the CA's distinguished name, and the signature of the certificate authority. You store this signed certificate in your key database.<br>
                    When you send this certificate to a receiver, the receiver performs two steps to verify your identity:</p>
                     <ol>
                     <li>Uses your public key that comes with the certificate to check your digital signature.</li>
                     <li>Verifies that the CA that issued your certificate is legitimate and trustworthy. To do this, the receiver needs the public key of the CA. The receiver might already hold an assured copy of the public key of the CA in their key database, but if not, the receiver must acquire an additional digital certificate to obtain the public key of the CA. This certificate might in turn depend on the digital certificate of another CA; there might be a hierarchy of certificates issued by multiple CAs, each depending on the validity of the next. Eventually, however, the receiver needs the public key of the root CA. The root CA is the CA at the top of the hierarchy. To trust the validity of the digital certificate of the root CA, the public-key user must receive that digital certificate in a secure manner, such as through a download from an authenticated server, or with preloaded software received from a reliable source, or on a securely delivered diskette.</li>    
                     </ol>
                    <p>Many applications that send a digital certificate to a receiver send not just their own certificate, but also all of the CA digital certificates necessary to verify the hierarchy of certificates up to the root CA certificate.<br>
                    For a digital certificate to be entirely trustworthy, the owner of the digital certificate must have carefully protected their private key, for example, by encrypting it on their computer's hard drive. If their private key has been compromised, an imposter could misuse their digital certificate.<br>
                    You can use self-signed digital certificates for testing purposes. A self-signed digital certificate contains your distinguished name, your public key, and your signature.</p>
